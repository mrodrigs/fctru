# About this project
The idea of the App is:

*"To provide an always updated menu of the University Restaurant on the hand of FCT-Unesp students."*

The app is built with react-native and expo.

# Why?

It started because students needed to browse through FCT-Unesp website to have information about the University Restaurant and a mobile app is nicer to have =).

# Functionalities

+ University Restaurant Menu.
+ General information about the facility and how does it work.
